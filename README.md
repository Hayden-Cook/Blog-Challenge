# Week 4 Challenge: My Blog

## Description
This repository is my first challenge at using web APIs in Javascript. The deployment link will take the user to a page that gives them the options to log blog entries. Once they have submitted a post, they are redirected to a new page that hosts the user's blog posts. On this page, the user will find a back button, redirecting them to the blog's main page, and a theme button. The theme button can be used to toggle the "light" and "dark" modes on the blog page.
